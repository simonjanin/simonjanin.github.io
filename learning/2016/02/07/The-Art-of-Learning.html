    <p>Notes article learning.</p>

<p>In the last two months, I spent my entire time – literally – studying and learning. Out of this intense experience, I believe there are many lessons that can be learned.
In this article, I will try to lay down some of the principles for successful learning. Some are paramount, while others are more a matter of personal taste or minors tweaks to reach optimal performance.</p>

<p>First, we will focus on the most important aspect: the why. Why are we learning/studying? Willpower can get us only so far, and unsustainable activities usually don’t give us enough time to truly master a skill. More than anything else, the sheer amount of hours is what separates the expert from the average practitioner. But obviously the expertise-hours relation is simply a correlation, what counts in the end is the amount of <em>work</em> that has been done. Physically, work is defined as the amount of Force (<script type="math/tex">F</script>) times velocity  (<script type="math/tex">\mathbf{v}</script>) during a given period (<script type="math/tex">t_1</script> to <script type="math/tex">t_2</script>); or equivalently, the amount of Force over a Curve (<script type="math/tex">C</script>).</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">W =  \int_{t_1}^{t_2}\mathbf{F} \cdot \mathbf{v}dt =\int_C \mathbf{F} \cdot d\mathbf{s}</script>

<p><em>Sorry about that. I just had to put some math in there.</em></p>

<p>This equation tells us the importance not only of how much time we spend, but also at which <em>velocity</em>. This reminds of the saying: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Perfect practice makes perfect</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the physical work analogy, perfection is measured by how much we learn at each instant (the velocity).</p>

<p>In yet another sense, the path we take is critical because a movement that comes back to its original point has, in physics, done absolutely no work!</p>

<h3 id="focus-on-the-why">Focus on the why</h3>
<p>Why are you learning whatever you set to learn? What impact does it have on your life, on your relationships, on your wellbeing? Connecting our learning goals to a larger vision helps stay motivated when times get rough.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I do this, because [..]
This is what I was meant to do. This makes me a [..]
Once I have learned this, I will be able to [..]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Those are great sentences you can tell yourself to remember why what you do is important.
It’s even easier to stay motivated when your goals have a strong social component: having one’s actions impact other human-beings we care about is perhaps the biggest reason why billions of people get out of bed everyday; be it a mother who cares for her childs, or a worker who fears the judgment of his colleagues if he arrives just a few minutes later than them at work.
If those social incentives are not present, it’s really important to manifacture them: find partners who have similar goals, and who can hold you accountable. This holds for waking up early, as well as for how much work you put in and for pushing you to do things that you keep on putting off.</p>

<h3 id="reverse-engineering">Reverse Engineering</h3>
<p>If you had to learn how to build a car in a day, how would you do it?
Would you pick a book on physics, mechanical engineering, calculus, linear algebra? Or would you take a car and try to reverse engineer it, taking it appart component by component – learning to </p>

<p>Reverse engineering.
*What do successful people do?
*How do they spend their time?
*What are their standards.</p>

<p>Motivation: start with why
Objective: start with the end in mind. Understand what is required first, then optimize the path to get there.</p>

<p>Social incentives and structure. The reason why billions people wake up each days, and lack thereof is also why people can’t get up from bed: no social incentive.
Collaboration. Challenge each other. Teach to learn. Learn to teach. Learn to impress. Learn to compete. Learn to connect. Learn to help.
White board. Group dynamics.
Personality types. Introverts. Extroverts.
Make it fun. X% play, 1-X% structured learning.</p>

<p>Feedback: as frequent, as quick and as accurate as possible. Start (very) small, grow complex.
Performance norms
objective norms:
*points (in an actual test/critical setting)
*time
Subjective norms:
*feeling (how well I feel I understand)</p>

<p>Raising your standards:
*“The cleaner” metaphor : how to clean everything. Anything less is unacceptable.
*“The pragmatic” : what are the 20/80. What is essential/superficial.
*“The idealist” : what matters is that I understood. Own judgment of performance more important than  standardized results. Often delusional.</p>

<p>Measuring work.
*pomodoro (ideally group-synchronized)
-&gt;separate work and breaks
-&gt;full focus/full relax
*expected credits</p>

<p>Planning and organization.
What needs to be done? Years, Months, Month, Week, Day.
Think like an investor: you invest time to get knowledge/skills/revenues, etc. Expected outcome is always the first thing to consider: it’s not rational to study 4 hours for 0.5 credits if you can make 2 credits in 8 hours. Prioritize.
*Have a daily/weekly/monthly metric.
-&gt;[Credits/hour]
-&gt;[Revenue (potential or actual)/hour]
If you have 250 hours and 50 credits to do, that means 0.2 credit/hour - or 20 centicredit/hour.
Good metrics help monitor learning, they become a major source of motivation; because the work-reward relationship becomes solid. Avoids frustration. Keep oneself focused.</p>

<p>Deadlines and Parkinson’s law.
Once you have a clear goal, make yourself accountable. Social incentives. Mutual checking.
Give yourself less time.</p>

<p>Not just a to do list, an item list.
List every skill/object that you need to learn. To could be in a cahier. A page, a skill/concept. Tick it once you master it. Or give it a bar every time you go deeper: reward.</p>

<p>Truth is in the sparring.
Most martial arts are utterly useless for self-defense. No grounding in reality: waste of time, fragile. Ju-jitsu. Muay thai. Mma - as realistic as you can make it. Anti fragile (if new technique, then people adapt). Free fight vs. “competition” (with points).
Theory without practice is like a table with two feet: looks perfect until you shake it or look under it.
Tests, exams, exercises. Correction. Feedback. Repeat.</p>

<p>Learn like you needed it today. Record your learning: cahier, photos (white board/sheets), videos. Set up things in such a way that if you needed this information in 10 years, you could find it and understand it in little to no time.</p>

<p>Rehearsal. Repetition. Variation.
Then make it harder than it will be: less time, no help. Make it different - can you find your center of gravity in this novel situation? What if [this] instead of [that]?</p>
