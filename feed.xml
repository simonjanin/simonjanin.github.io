        <title>A Proof of Stake based voting system proposal to fund the Ethereum foundation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Projects of the scale and complexity of Ethereum and Bitcoin are typically subjected to the issue of how to fund them.
The Bitcoin Foundation is founded by a consequent number of actors, some relatively large Bitcoin-based ventures as well as a fair number of individuals.
Nonetheless, as of today, only three members of the Bitcoin foundation are actually paid salaries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ethereum is a very complex project, and it seems obvious that it could not be realized with only three full-time developers -- notwithstanding the large open-source participation it has benefited from, the core development of the platform requires a large focused effort.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There have been a few proposals on how to fund the Ethereum foundation in the future: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;sponsorships&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;calls for donation&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;creating new ether that would be sold by the foundation (typically in the new genesis block)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;having miners pay a fraction of the mining fees they collected (or of the reward of the block they mined).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those options are not mutually exclusive – although I particularly dislike the third option of artificially increasing supply.
In this article I will explore the last possibility, focusing solely on Proof of Stake – which, to my knowledge, has not been proposed before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-proposal&quot;&gt;The proposal&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First off, let me say that this would probably not be adapted for Proof of Work – because of the nothing at stake problem; this is why we need Proof of Stake.
Alright, let’s get started!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us introduce the parameter &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/script&gt; which is the percentage of the transactions fees that will be donated to the Ethereum foundation (it could apply to the block reward as well, this depends on the actual Proof of Stake implementation, so I will stick to the first option for now).
Each time a new block is generated, that is every 17 seconds as of today, each validator &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;i&lt;/script&gt; of the platform will cast a vote &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;v_{i} \in [0,M]&lt;/script&gt; of weight &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;w_{i}&lt;/script&gt; linearly proportional to its actual bounded stake in the platform in the form of a percentage. &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
0 &lt; M \leq 1 %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt; is the maximal allowed value for a vote
The vote &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;v_{i}&lt;/script&gt; corresponds to the &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/script&gt; value that the validator wishes to be enforced. Concretely he would choose &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;v_{i} = 0.00&lt;/script&gt; if he would like &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/script&gt; to become &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;0&lt;/script&gt;, while he would select &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;% &lt;![CDATA[
0 &lt; v_{i} \leq 1 %]]&gt;&lt;/script&gt; otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After every validator has voted, the &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/script&gt; value for the present block is given bya simple weighted sum: &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p = \sum_{i} v_{i} *w_{i}&lt;/script&gt;. Additionnally, we could limit &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/script&gt; within some range, typically &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;0.5&lt;/script&gt; or less.
To make things simpler, a validator casts his vote &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;v_{i}&lt;/script&gt; each time he bonds some stake in the platform, and he can change his vote every &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;/script&gt; blocks for &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;T&lt;/script&gt; desirably relatively large but smaller than the bonding time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead of limiting this feature to sending transactions fees to the address of the Ethereum Foundation, this could be extended into a full-fledged feature of the validating algorithm – for funding related side projects. This might be interesting; although there are quite a few subtleties that would introduce additional complexity and might divert this proposal from its original purpose. So let us stay focused on our main goal: funding the Ethereum Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;consensus&quot;&gt;Consensus&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple tweak would be directly implemented into the Proof of Stake validation algorithm in such a way that each block validator would automatically send &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;1-p\%&lt;/script&gt; of the transactions fees to himself and &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p\%&lt;/script&gt; to a smart contract belonging to the Ethereum Foundation. In order for this mechanism to be enforced by all validators, the majority of validators would need to mark blocks that don’t respect this mechanism as invalid.
Obviously, if all validators collude, they could choose not to enforce this mechanism, but they may as well just all vote for &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p=0&lt;/script&gt;, so they have no incentive to game the system (in the form I described above).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;economical-incentives-analysis&quot;&gt;Economical incentives analysis&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far we have only used very simple mathematics. Many different such mechanisms can be conveived of, but we only present the most basic here as it might be good enough.
Let us now see if our proposal is robust in term of incentives.
Obviously, since the Ethereum Foundation members as well as the Foundation itself own some Ethers, they could cast the highest vote possible &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;v_{i} = M&lt;/script&gt; every time in order to receive more fees – and as they receive more ether, they could bond more stake in order to increase their voting share, creating a feedback loop. I believe that this isn’t a real issue in practice, and I am sure that the foundation will behave honestly but for the sake of security let us try to mitigate this possibility.
First, we could simply set the &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;M&lt;/script&gt; value lower in the validator client implementation, i.e. &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;M = 0.25&lt;/script&gt; (this number is very easily verifiable in the source code so there is no incentive to cheat and getting caught in changing it in an update would create a hard fork – so they don’t have an incentive to do this).
Or another mitigation would be to set M even lower and introduce an additional ceiling &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;C&lt;/script&gt;, where it would be possible to vote above M but the validator would have to pay &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt; M + C &gt; p&lt;/script&gt; while the other validators who voted &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;v_{i} \leq M&lt;/script&gt; would only pay &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/script&gt; – this would furthermore make it possible for altruists to fund the Ethereum Foundation even more generously if they so wish (without forcing others to pay more than &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p&lt;/script&gt;). This last parameter &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;C&lt;/script&gt; makes it not profitable for a &lt;em&gt;potentially malicious&lt;/em&gt; foundation to cheat because in order to cast the recent gains as a vote to increase p, they need to bond this stake; and in the theoretical worst case, they would achieve at most &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;p = M&lt;/script&gt;, although I believe that this might not even be possible to raise it that high in practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;psychological-layer&quot;&gt;Psychological layer&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a future validator once we switch to Proof of Stake, I perceive this proposal as a fair balance between subsidizing the Ethereum Foundation and profiting from the transactions fees. Validators benefit greatly from a continuous development of the platform, since the security of their stake depends on it. This symbiotic relationship between the Ethereum Foundation, the core programmers and validators paves the way for a future where each actor wins from the bettermen of the platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the switch to Proof of Stake is something that long-term holders desire, and this way of funding the Foundation would further incentivize the switch to Proof of Stake – from which both would benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In light of our quick analysis, this mechanism seems to fit nicely into the Proof of Stake system and the incentive structure appears to be pretty robust.
Also, I believe that the community will probably not be opposed to this since every validator has his word, and everyone contributes equally – while altruits are given the possiblity to contribute even more if they wish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said before, this proposal is not mutually exclusive to the other options of funding the Foundation, but this seems the fairest one. No inflation. No secret. No outside influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am looking forward to reading your comments and suggestions for improving this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks to HodlDwon for bringing up the issue of funding.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ethereum for Investors -- Introduction</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Since my last article on Ethereum, I have diven deep into the platform: I read extensively on the topic and watched countless videos to help me understand the technicalities of the blockchain; this drive translated into the urge to record YouTube videos and to start a channel dedicated to Ethereum and blockchain technologies.
Today, I release a video aimed at potential investors in Ethereum (and the ecosystem around it) – people who are programmers, enthusiasts, newcomers or venture capitalists.
My goal is to make Ethereum accessible to more people, and to help them understand the platform better – especially since so many questions are coming up again and again on reddit and the forums (the issuance model, the applications, smart contracts, DAPPS, Proof of Stake, Regulations, etc.).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/nDY0s_e3n34&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the slides of this presentation &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1h8Ym143zzwRYx2vgLwLw5P_QA2CvKpJOzx_3Tv7xhFE/edit?usp=sharing&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next week, I will release a video purely focused on investment: what are the risks and opportunities, how to think about Ethereum and what factors are most important to make good investing decisions. I will also talk specifically about the projects and startups that are flourishing in the Ethereum ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>On Cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum - and how to price them</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve recently discovered &lt;strong&gt;Ethereum&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;code&gt;more than a cryptocurrency, it is a general-purpose Turing-complete blockchain-based platform for hosting decentralized applications&lt;/code&gt;. I had been waiting for something like Ethereum for more than two years, after I realized that the potential of Bitcoin was limited by its inherent weaknesses in term of mining, centralization and incentive structure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I had promised myself to seize the next blockchain-based opportunity, and I feel that Ethereum could be it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But its complexity makes it difficult to grasp, so after quite a bit a research I decided to make a video of what I found to help me understand and price Ethereum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/16cSBp2NW3o&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;video-outline&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Video outline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[0:00]&lt;/strong&gt; Introduction: the various cryptocurrencies&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1:30]&lt;/strong&gt; Ethereum prices of the last month&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[4:30]&lt;/strong&gt; Market Cap&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[8:20]&lt;/strong&gt; Ethereum mining hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[10:40]&lt;/strong&gt; Total Ether supply&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[11:40]&lt;/strong&gt; Block difficulty&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[12:40]&lt;/strong&gt; Refutation of hypothesis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[14:30]&lt;/strong&gt; An interesting contract…&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[16:30]&lt;/strong&gt; Inside story&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[18:00]&lt;/strong&gt; A convincing prediction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[19:00]&lt;/strong&gt; Summary&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[22:10]&lt;/strong&gt; Further prediction&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[24:00]&lt;/strong&gt; Speculation and analysis; comparision with Bitcoin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[27:50]&lt;/strong&gt; Conclusion&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[29:00]&lt;/strong&gt; Notes about the potential of Ethereum&lt;/li&gt;

        <title>To solve the Theory of everything, solve AI first</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In this 16 minutes talk, co-founder and CEO of Deepmind (now Google Deepmind) Demis Hassabis presents his ideas and goals on artificial intelligence and learning. He goes on to say that utimately, we need to solve AI to solve the grand questions of humankind - the grandest one being the theory of everything, a perfect physical model of the universe accounting for litteraly &lt;code&gt;everything&lt;/code&gt;. It might indeed take an AI to solve the inconsistencies physicists encounter at sub-nano level at very high energies, since those problems require to both use quantum mechanics and general relativity - which collide in the extreme cases. 
&amp;lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/rbsqaJwpu6A&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a Go player, I am tempted to make a prediction on the evolution of computer Go. I have been warned from making such risky predictions, but I feel that even if I turn out to be wrong, I’ll learn from them since I’ll have written them down - this Blog will serve as a track-record for my predictions, and I’m looking forward to seeing how badly I’m wrong in a few years!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I predict that computers will be able to play Go at the professional level within the next 5 years; more precisely, I expect a computer to be able to win at least a game out of four against a professional player with a rank of at least 1p on a 19x19 board with the computer taking black with komi &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;\geq 0.5&lt;/script&gt;. This has to happen by 13/09/2020 – Simon Janin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe it’s within reach in 3 years or less, but 5 years seems like a fair bet.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Lessons from Nassim Taleb&#39;s book Antifragile</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I just finished reading Nassim Taleb’s book &lt;em&gt;Antifragile&lt;/em&gt;, I’ll try to distill some of the lessons we can derive from it, from the theoretical to the practical.
My goal is to clarify the concepts used in the book as well as to apply them broadly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Essentially, we are interested in systems and their responses to stressors and volatility: be it financial systems (i.e. the stock market), supply chains, biological systems (ecosystems, societies), physical systems (machinery, chemical systems, etc) and so forth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are already familiar with the notions of fragility and robustness, but let us define them rigorously:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a system is &lt;strong&gt;fragile&lt;/strong&gt; when the response to stress gets &lt;em&gt;super-linearly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;worse&lt;/code&gt; as stress &lt;code&gt;increases&lt;/code&gt; (up to a certain point). &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a system is &lt;strong&gt;robust&lt;/strong&gt; when the response to stress is &lt;em&gt;linear&lt;/em&gt; (up to a certain point).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, there is a third possibility: antifragility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;a system is &lt;strong&gt;antifragile&lt;/strong&gt; when the response to stress gets &lt;strong&gt;at most&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;sub-linearly&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;worse&lt;/code&gt; as stress &lt;code&gt;increases&lt;/code&gt; and potentially better (up to a certain point).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the third case, the system somehow &lt;strong&gt;gains from disorder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;examples-of-fragile-robust-and-antifragile-systems---and-definitions&quot;&gt;Examples of fragile, robust and antifragile systems - and definitions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will give a few examples of real-world systems and classify them.
Note, though, that those notions only apply &lt;code&gt;up to a certain point&lt;/code&gt;; 
that is, a completely destroyed system doesn’t get any worse (because it doesn’t exist anymore), 
and a robust or an antifragile system eventually breaks down under a certain level of stress as well (to convince ourselves that this is true, we go back to the laws of physics: any physical system exposed to a high enough energy will collapse).
We are therefore talking about the &lt;code&gt;expected real-world behavior of a system within a given range&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;peer-to-peer-systems&quot;&gt;Peer-to-peer systems&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their seminal paper on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/hotbots07/tech/full_papers/wang/wang_html/&quot;&gt;peer-to-peer Botnets, Wang et al. (2007)&lt;/a&gt; showed that their botnet was very resistant to outside attackers trying to take it down (i.e law enforcement).
The following figure is directly taken from the paper. We notice that &lt;code&gt;taking down less than 70% of the bots in the network has virtually no effect on connectivity&lt;/code&gt; - a striking manifestion of robustness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/downloads/antifragileBotnet.png&quot; alt=&quot;Antifragile Botnet&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the network gets stronger (more resilient) as more bots join the network (&lt;strong&gt;antifragile&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the network isn’t affected by partial take-down attemps (&lt;strong&gt;robust&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the network has a single point of failure, namely the private key of the bot master (&lt;strong&gt;fragile&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This clearly shows that &lt;code&gt;a given system can simultaneously have parts which are fragile, robust and/or antifragile&lt;/code&gt; : 
&lt;strong&gt;those notions are therefore entirely context-specific&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the figure we see that the botnet is robust (has a linear response to stress) until about 70% of bots are taken down, at which point the botnet becomes fragile (has an exponentially worse response to stress) and collapses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A good heuristic to judge the (anti)-fragility of a system is to &lt;code&gt;ask whether it is accelerating towards harm or benefit&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;a-note-on-convexity-concavity-and-linearity&quot;&gt;A note on convexity, concavity and linearity&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex&quot;&gt;f(x)&lt;/script&gt; be a function describing the stress to response relationship of a system. Typically (but not necessarily), the function will be of one of the following types:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Linear functions&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Convex (concave down) or Concave&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/downloads/linear-relationship.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;linear functions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/downloads/convex-concave.gif&quot; alt=&quot;convex and concave functions&quot; /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(a) and (b) are equivalent, but in one case the function is increasing and the other decreasing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(a) could be the damage done over time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(b) could be the health of the system over time&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(c) is typically the graph of a robust system (up to a certain point) - compare with the figure of the botnet above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Concave up increasing could represent a fragile system (super-linear damage over time)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Concave down (convex) increasing could represent an antifragile system (takes proportionally less damage over time)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note that by changing our axis we change the concavity of the function, so it’s important to know the quantities we are dealing with to distinguish fragility from anti-fragility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;talebs-definition&quot;&gt;Taleb’s definition&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are now ready to understand Taleb’s own definition of the concept of antifragility:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Simply, antifragility is defined as a convex response to a stressor or source of harm (for some range of variation), leading to a positive sensitivity to increase in volatility (or variability, stress, dispersion of outcomes, or uncertainty, what is grouped under the designation “disorder cluster”). Likewise fragility is defined as a concave sensitivity to stressors, leading a negative sensitivity to increase in volatility. The relation between fragility, convexity, and sensitivity to disorder is mathematical, obtained by theorem, not derived from empirical data mining or some historical narrative. It is a priori”. — Nassem Taleb&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-anti-fragility-of-evolution&quot;&gt;The anti-fragility of Evolution&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we take a look at the multiple iterations that a given species has gone during its Evolution, we notice that &lt;code&gt;the genetic information is antifragile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Animal die, but the species get better and fitter with time - the good genetic information gets passed along (on average), and the bad one is weeded out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-anti-fragility-of-cryptography&quot;&gt;The anti-fragility of Cryptography&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cryptography is the art and science of using mathematical objects to secure and hide information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cryptographic systems themselves are at most robust, but the methods that are being developped to build stronger systems and analyse them are constantly refined. And each successful attack on a cipher or any cryptographic function makes the process better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;For cryptography to be antifragile, it has to get better at a faster rate than cryptanalysis gets better&lt;/code&gt;. Especially when we consider that problems such as factoring large numbers get increasingly hard with an increase in key size; while generating two (increasingly) large primes number doesn’t get much harder with an increase in key size.
That means that even if we were to have a practical polynomial factoring algorithm (be it for example with Shor’s algorithm using a quantum computer, or a classical computer algorithm): as long as it is comparatively easier to generate two (very) large prime numbers than to factor their product for increasing key-size, public key cryptography is antifragile (an increase in key-size as well as computational power makes the system more robust/secure).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;open-source-and-anti-fragility&quot;&gt;Open-source and anti-fragility&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open-source collaboration, be it Wikipedia or Linux, is inherently anti-fragile:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;decentralized&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;produces reversible, small errors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;gains from a larger number of contributors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;empirical and grounded in reality&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this short article I tried to give an intuition, if not an overview, of the concept of antifragility.
There are many other lessons to be learned from this book, which may justify a second article!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Genesis of a Blog</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have long had an interest in writting, especially on conceptual topics - this blog is my attempt at delivering value on the topics I know the best, as well as to learn more about topics I am less familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s quite natural for me to write most of the posts in English, since it’s the language that will certainly create the most value for most people; I expect to write some articles in French, and maybe a few in German if the opportunity arises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;formating&quot;&gt;Formating&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be using &lt;code&gt;mathjax&lt;/code&gt; for formatting LaTeX, here’s a test:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;script type=&quot;math/tex; mode=display&quot;&gt;e = \lim_{n \to \infty}{(1 + \frac{1}{n})^{n}}&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks pretty good!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s try now to highlight some &lt;code&gt;assembly code&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-asm&quot; data-lang=&quot;asm&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt; 1 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt; 2 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt; 3 &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nl&quot;&gt;exec:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt; 4 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;eax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;eax&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt; 5 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ebx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ebx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt; 6 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ecx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ecx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt; 7 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;edx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;edx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt; 8 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt; 9 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;11&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;10 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;11 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;12 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;13 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0x80&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;14 &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;15 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;al&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;16 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ebx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;ebx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;17 &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0x80&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;looking-forward&quot;&gt;Looking forward&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I set myself the goal to write a blog post every week for the next few months, either on a book I am reading, or on the various topics I’m interested in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I am looking forward to writting some more posts and I hope my readers will like it&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
